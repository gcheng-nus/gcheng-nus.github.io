<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Institute of Operations Research and Analytics at the National University of Singapore, advised by <a href="https://www.joelgoh.net/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(73, 78, 82);">Joel Goh</a> and <a href="https://www.sidikatunccandogan.com/" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(73, 78, 82)">Sidika Tunc Candogan</a>.

My research focuses on practitioner-inspired and data-grounded problems in healthcare operations. 
I work closely with healthcare practitioners to study research questions that arise from real challenges.
Methodologically, I apply analytical modeling, empirical analysis, and field experimentation to develop evidence-based tools for decision-making in healthcare delivery.
By bridging analytics with real-world implementation, my work generates insights that inform hospital and digital healthcare platform operations.
Overall, I aim to improve healthcare delivery and, ultimately, the quality of patient care. 

<!-- My research focuses on data-driven decision-making and behavioral interventions in healthcare operations and medical decision-making. I apply data analytics, econometrics analysis, and field experiments to study how healthcare policies and interventions shape both patient and provider behavior.

By bridging analytics with real-world implementation, my work provides insights that inform hospital operations and digital healthcare platforms. Through rigorous data analysis and experimentation, I aim to contribute to evidence-based decision-making in healthcare and service operations, offering practical implications for both academia and industry.

Broadly speaking, I work on practitioner-driven data-grounded problems in healthcare delivery. 
Typically, my research questions are from real challenges faced by healthcare practitioners I collaborate with. I like talking to practitioners, learning from their needs, and then thinking about how our OM researchers can help.
Methodology-wise, I combine different methods such as empirical analysis, field experimentation, and analytical modeling, but data is always at the core of my work. I like the type of work that validates the proposed strategies using real data.
Overall, my goal is to develop tools and insights to improve healthcare delivery, and ultimately and most importantly, the quality of patient care.  -->
