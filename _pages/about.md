<p style="font-size: 16px; margin-top: -1em">
Hi, I'm Guang CHENG! I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at National University of Singapore.
I am fortunate to be advised by Joel Goh.
My primary research interests are in data-driven modeling with applications in healthcare operations management and medical decision making.
